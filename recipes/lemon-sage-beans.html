    <h2>These stove top beans are easy to make and are delicious as a side, sauce, or main staple with rice.</h2>
    <p>Beans, beans, beans! I mean come on, who doesn't like legumes? And if you find them cook them this to change their mind!</p>
    <p><strong>Always wash your beans. A hand held strainer makes this much easier.</strong></p>

        <li>1 can of Great Northern Beans, drained and thoroughly rinsed with cold water</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon EVOO</li>
        <li>3-4 garlic cloves pressed or diced</li>
        <li>1/2 a fresh lemon</li>
        <li>1-2 tablespoon sage</li>
        <li>1-2 tablespoon of cumin may be subsituted for sage</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Drain and rinse beans and set to side</li>
        <li>Heat sauce pan on high, add EVOO, and briefly saute garlic</li>
        <li>Add rinsed beans then add water until beans covered with about 1/4 inch of water above them</li>
