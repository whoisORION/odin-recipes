    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 (4 ounce) bone-in chicken drumsticks, with skin</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 pinch garlic salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch seasoned salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a glass baking dish with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Spread 1/4 cup of olive oil over the bottom of the prepared baking dish and line up drumsticks on top, alternating directions so that they fit. Top with 1 tablespoon of butter each, on the thick part of the chicken. Sprinkle with garlic salt, seasoned salt, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 35 minutes. Cover chicken with remaining olive oil; continue to bake until juices run clear and chicken is no longer pink in the centers, 10 to 15 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Serve.</li>
