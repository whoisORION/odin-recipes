    <h2>This is a personal favorite, written straight from the heart</h2>
    <p>This is one of the dishes I feel I truly can cook well. Master it and you'll impress anyone you make it for!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Literally any steak, but a cut with some marbling and ranging from 3/4 inch to 1 inch is easiest</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Heafty coating of Montreal or Canadian steak seasoning</li>
        <li>OR course salt and ground pepper</li>
        <li>2-3 garlic cloves pressed or thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove steak from fridge season with Montreal seasoning or salt and paper. Then allow to warm to room temperature (approx. 30 min)</li>
        <li>Heat cast iron skillet on high heat until it is very hot and almost smoking, remove from heat allow to cool briefly, return to high heat, then add EVOO, butter, and finally garlic for a very very quick saute (15sec-30sec).</li>
        <li>Quickly add the room temperature steak to the pan and aggressively sear for 30 seconds, turn down heat to Med-High and set timer for 2 minutes</li>
        <li>Using a spoon baste the steak in the butter, EVOO, and garlic mixture, flip the steak, baste the side that was just down, and restart timer for 2 minutes</li>
        <li>Remove steak from skillet place on a plate and cover tightly in aluminum foil for 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cut steak into slices and marvel at your perfectly even medium rare meat. The secret is all in the resting time under foil. Adjust times to compensate for steak thickness and level of cooked preferences</li>

    </ol>
